# Section F: Embedded Systems & IoT

## Q1. Everyday Embedded Systems
Examples of embedded systems at home:
- Washing machine: Controls washing cycles and timing
- Microwave oven: Controls heating and timer functions
- Air conditioner: Regulates temperature automatically

---

## Q2. IoT vs Regular Embedded System
An IoT device is connected to the internet and can send or receive data remotely.

Example:
- Smart thermostat (IoT)
- Traditional thermostat (non-IoT)

## Q3. Soil Moisture Sensor Data Flow
1. Sensor detects soil moisture level
2. Microcontroller processes sensor data
3. Data is sent to the cloud
4. Gardener receives notification on mobile app

---

## Q4. Challenges in Embedded Programming
Two unique challenges:
- Limited memory and processing power
- Power consumption constraints

---

## Q5. Sleep Mode in IoT Devices
Battery-powered IoT devices sleep to conserve energy.

Trade-off:
- Slight delay in real-time response
