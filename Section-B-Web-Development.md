## Q1. Form Not Submitting – Troubleshooting
To troubleshoot a form submission issue, I would:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Validate HTML form fields
3. Verify JavaScript event handling
4. Check backend API response
5. Confirm database connectivity

## Q2. Frontend vs Backend (Restaurant Analogy)
- *HTML*: Menu (structure)
- *CSS*: Restaurant design and appearance
- *JavaScript*: Waiter (interaction)
- *Backend*: Kitchen (logic and data processing)

## Q3. Social Media App Data Flow
When a user posts a message:
1. Frontend captures user input
2. API sends data to backend server
3. Backend stores data in database
4. Other users receive updates via notifications or WebSockets

## Q4. Core Frontend Technologies
The three core frontend technologies are:
- *HTML*: Structure of the webpage
- *CSS*: Styling and layout
- *JavaScript*: User interaction and logic

---

## Q5. Database Structure
I would create two tables:
- *Users* (user_id, name, email, profile_picture)
- *Posts* (post_id, user_id, content, timestamp)

Each user can have multiple posts (one-to-many relationship).
