## Q1. Handling Multiple Student Records
Instead of using separate variables, I would use data structures like arrays, lists, or objects.
This approach is scalable, efficient, and easier to maintain.

## Q2. Debugging an Average Calculation Issue
If a program returns incorrect average values, I would check:
1. Data types (integer vs float division)
2. Loop logic and conditions
3. Total sum and count calculation

## Q3. Function Explained with Analogy
A function is like a machine:
- You give input
- The machine processes it
- You get output

Functions help reuse code and make programs organized.

## Q4. Pseudo-Code Explanation
Pseudo-code is a simple, human-readable way to plan logic before coding.
Input 5 numbers
Set max = first number
For each number
   If number > max
      max = number
Print max

## Q5. Team Collaboration on Code
To avoid overwriting code, I would use:
- Git version control
- Branches for each feature
- Pull requests for merging code## Q5. Team Collaboration on Code
